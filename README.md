Fast and extensible workspace manager written in Rust:

- **Fast:** Written in Rust with performance in mind.
- **Extensible:** Supports custom scripts and plugins.
- **Cross-platform:** Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Private:** Blue doesn't collect any data.

## Features

Improve the DX (Developer Experience) of your workspace. Blue can help you with:

- **Workspace setup:** Automatically install dependencies, tools, and extensions.
- **Environment variables:** Create environment templates and delegate variables to projects from a single source file.
- **Maintenance:** Update dependencies, languages, package managers, and more with a single command.
- **Configuration:** Use presets for common build, test, and deployment scenarios and enforce consistent file extensions.
- **Customization:** Developers can override workspace settings with their own preferences.
- **Clean-up:** Manually or automatically delete temporary files and folders.
- **Environment Checks:** Ensure your workspace is set up correctly.
- **Project Management:** Create, delete, and manage projects easily.
- **Conventional Commits:** Utilize Git hooks to enforce conventional commits.
- **Custom Scripts:** Add custom scripts to be run with Git Bash.
- **GitHub:** Ensure your repository is compliant with GitHub's best practices.
- **Docker Management:** Manage your Docker containers and images with ease.
- **Reusability:** Create reusable workspace and project templates and publish them to GitHub.
- **Analytics:** Gain valuable insight into your workspace.

## Getting Started

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still in development, don't expect any of the features to work. I (Slekup) also don't have a macOS device to test on, so macOS support is not guaranteed. If you want to help with macOS support, that would be greatly appreciated.
